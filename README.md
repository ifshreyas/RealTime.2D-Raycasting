# Real-Time 2D Raycasting & Field-of-Sight Visualizer

A standalone real-time 2D computational-geometry system built in C# that demonstrates raycasting, ray-to-line-segment intersection, and dynamic field-of-sight generation entirely through the console.

The project implements the underlying geometry algorithms from first principles instead of relying on a physics engine.

## How It Works

The system places an observer inside a 2D environment containing wall segments.

Rays are generated from the observer across a configurable field of view.

Each ray is tested against every wall.

## Ray Representation

A ray is represented parametrically as:

```text
P + tD
```

Where:

- `P` is the ray origin
- `D` is the normalized direction
- `t` represents distance along the ray

---

## Ray-Segment Intersection

Walls are represented as line segments.

The system solves the intersection between:

```text
Ray:

P + tD
```

and:

```text
Segment:

A + uS
```

The 2D cross product is used:

```text
cross(A, B) = AxBy - AyBx
```

The resulting parameters are:

```text
t = cross(A - P, S) / cross(D, S)

u = cross(A - P, D) / cross(D, S)
```

A valid intersection satisfies:

```text
t >= 0
```

and:

```text
0 <= u <= 1
```

If multiple walls intersect a ray, the intersection with the smallest positive `t` is selected.

---

## Field of Sight

After calculating the closest intersection for each ray, the resulting visibility points are sorted by angle.

The ordered points form the boundary of the visible region.

```text
              WALL
        ───────────────

             \ | /
              \|/
           --- @ ---
              /|             / | 
        FIELD OF SIGHT
```

## Controls

```text
W       Move player up
A       Move player left
S       Move player down
D       Move player right

R       Reset player position

ESC     Exit application
```

## Build

Clone the repository and enter the project directory.

Then:

```powershell
dotnet restore
```

Build the complete solution:

```powershell
dotnet build
```

---

## Run

Run the console application:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/RaycastingVisualizer
```

---

## Run Tests

Execute the complete test suite:

```powershell
dotnet test
```

The current test suite contains:

```text
14 tests
14 passed
0 failed
```

---

## Complexity

For:

```text
R = number of rays
W = number of walls
```

the basic raycasting algorithm performs:

```text
O(R × W)
```

intersection tests per frame.

For example:

```text
180 rays × 12 walls
= 2160 intersection tests
```

per raycasting update.

This implementation intentionally uses the straightforward approach so that the computational geometry remains easy to understand, test, and profile.

## Testing

The test suite covers:

- Cross-product calculations
- Ray/segment intersection
- Parallel geometry
- Intersections behind the ray
- Intersections outside segments
- Segment endpoint intersections
- Ray generation
- Wall intersection detection
- Closest-hit selection
- Visibility polygon construction
- Empty visibility data
- Visibility point preservation
